The Golden Acre was designed by the architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who also created the Albany City Hall and the New York State Capitol. The area features a mix of architectural styles, including Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance. The plaza and the garden are surrounded by several historic buildings, such as the Old Post Office, the Albany Academy, and the Fort Orange Club.
  
The Golden Acre was a thriving commercial center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, attracting many businesses and visitors. It was home to several hotels, theaters, restaurants, and shops. Some of the famous establishments that operated in the Golden Acre were the Delavan House, the Stanwix Hall, the Grand Central Hotel, and the Harmanus Bleecker Library. The area also hosted many parades, festivals, and celebrations.
  
The Golden Acre declined in popularity and prosperity in the mid-20th century, as urban development and suburbanization shifted the economic and social activity away from downtown Albany. Many of the historic buildings were demolished or abandoned, and the plaza and the garden fell into disrepair. The area became a site of crime, poverty, and decay. In recent years, however, there have been efforts to revitalize and preserve the Golden Acre as a cultural and historical landmark.
